In an attempt to re make a web application similar to what the original Microsoft project 1 is based on 
(stackoverflow) in a very short period of time I made 'UQuery'. The name comes from JQuery (I tried 
making something coding relatable. Again, similar to stackoverflow).
Originally, the plan was to make the user be able to make posts where users can interact with them and
give their own answers to it. However under the time constraint I couldn’t even finish some of the final 
interaction components and decided on a web application with the following: An application where a 
user can post their ‘wisdom’ of anything coding related, the post is categorised into groups, with the 
user being able to interact with the posts through likes,mindblows and disputes(all emojis). I achieved 
this through using supabase as I needed something quick and simple to store, add, update and fetch the 
data. I initially thought I’d be able to finish the project with just vanilla JavaScript, html and css but 
turned to React for the latter interaction components and linking everything together.
The only two things missing in the project is interaction with the emoji buttons and if a post has more 
red dispute emojis then likes then it would have received a DISPUTED tag or something similar.
Overall I still think there are enough features for it to be considered a good attempt. Thank you very 
much for reading.
